- Using the modulo and floor division operator
- Importing modules
- Using the Math and Random modules
- Lists and Sequence Functions
- Sets and Set Operations
- Creating and Accessing Dictionary, using dictionary methods
- Creating if-elseif-else and nested if statements
- Writing Conditional Expressions
- Using Logical Operators
- Creating for loop, foor-loop else and while loops
- Using range() function
- Creating User-defined Functions
- Nested Loops
- Loop Keywords
- String Methods
- User-Created Classes, Class Methods
- Defining Special Methods
- Defining Overloaded Operators
